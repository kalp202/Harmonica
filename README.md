# Music Recommendation System

## Overview
This project is a **Music Recommendation System** built using Python, Flask, Tailwind CSS, and ReactJS. It suggests music to users based on their previous listening history. The recommendation algorithm leverages **cosine similarity** to identify and recommend music tracks similar to the user's preferences.

## Features
- Scraped **10,000+ music records** from popular music platforms using **BeautifulSoup** and **requests**.
- **User-friendly interface** created with ReactJS and styled using Tailwind CSS.
- Efficient backend powered by Flask and Python for handling data and recommendations.
- Intelligent music recommendations based on user listening history using cosine similarity.

## Technologies Used
### Frontend
- **ReactJS**: For building the interactive user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For creating a responsive and modern design.

### Backend
- **Flask**: To serve the backend APIs and manage the recommendation logic.
- **Python**: For data processing, scraping, and implementing the recommendation algorithm.

### Data Collection
- **BeautifulSoup** and **requests**: For web scraping and collecting music data from multiple platforms.

### Algorithm
- **Cosine Similarity**: Used to compute similarity scores between user preferences and available music tracks.

## Usage
1. Launch the application in your browser.
2. Select your favourite songs.
3. View personalized music recommendations based on your song selection.

## Future Enhancements
- Advanced recommendation algorithms using machine learning models.
- User authentication to save and retrieve personalized recommendations.
